= Introduction =

The stemmer PHP extension can be installed following the instructions about building PHP extensions using phpize as described in the [http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.pecl.phpize.php PHP manual].


= Details =

To build this extension, you need to have the PHP development tools installed. For ubuntu/debian you can use `apt-get install php5-dev`.

The phpize command is used to prepare the build environment for a PHP extension. In the following sample, the sources for an extension are in a directory named stemmer-php:

{{{
 tar -xzf stemmer-php-*.tar.gz
 cd stemmer-php
 phpize
 ./configure
 make
 [sudo] make install
}}}

Edit you php.ini file and add the line `extension=stemmer.so`


== About libstemmer_c ==

The stemmer PHP extension uses a modified version of libstemmer_c. It has replaced the default Dutch stemming algorithm with the much better Kraaij-Pohlmann Dutch stemming algorithm. The modified version of this lib can be downloaded from [http://mysqludf.com/lib_mysqludf_stem mysqludf.com].
